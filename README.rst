This repository contains work for WES 237A (SP15), "Introduction to Embedded
Systems Design".

A single repository (https://bitbucket.org/jemele/wes237a/) has been created to
host all content. Per-assignment branches will be created to host assignment
specific content.

A wiki (https://bitbucket.org/jemele/wes237a/wiki/Home) contains up to date
information about the repository and all submitted assignments.

Issues concerning development workflow and assignment organization are also
tracked (https://bitbucket.org/jemele/wes237a/issues).
